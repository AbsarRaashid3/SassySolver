8 ÷ 2(2+2) = 1?,Incorrect! Correct solution: 8 ÷ 2×(2+2) = 8 ÷ 2×4 = 4×4 = 16. PEMDAS requires performing multiplication and division left‐to‐right after parentheses.
5² = 10 because 5×2=10,"Wrong notation! 5² means 5×5 = 25, not 5×2. Exponents denote repeated multiplication of the base."
1/2 + 1/3 = 2/5. Just add numerators and denominators!,Fraction error! The correct method is to find a common denominator: 1/2 = 3/6 and 1/3 = 2/6; so the sum is 5/6.
√16 = ±4 because squaring ±4 gives 16,"Partial misunderstanding! The symbol √16 represents the principal (nonnegative) square root, which is 4. To list both solutions of x² = 16, write x = ±4."
0.999... isn't equal to 1! It's just infinitely close.,"Common misconception! In fact, 0.999… equals 1 exactly. (Proof: Let x = 0.999…, then 10x = 9.999…, so 9x = 9 and x = 1.)"
6 ÷ 2(1+2) = 1? Ambiguous notation!,"Controversial! Depending on how you group the terms, (6 ÷ 2)(1+2) = 9 while 6 ÷ [2(1+2)] = 1. Always use clear parentheses to show your intended order."
5 × 0 = 5 because anything times zero is itself,Incorrect! Any number multiplied by 0 equals 0 by the zero property of multiplication.
Why is 0! = 1? Shouldn't it be 0?,By definition! 0! is defined as 1 to maintain consistency in combinatorial formulas and the gamma function.
ln(e²) = e² because ln and e cancel,Nope! ln(e²) = 2 since ln(e^k) = k. Logarithms and exponentials are inverse functions—but you must apply the rules correctly.
1/0 = 0 because nothing divided is zero,Undefined! Division by zero is not allowed since it leads to contradictions; the limits as x→0 diverge rather than equaling a number.
"(a + b)² = a² + b², right?",Missing middle term! (a + b)² expands to a² + 2ab + b². Use the FOIL method to see all the terms.
log(a + b) = log a + log b,False! The log rule applies to products: log(ab) = log a + log b. There’s no rule that allows you to split a logarithm of a sum.
0.1 × 0.1 = 0.1 because decimals multiply directly,"No! 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01. When multiplying decimals, multiply as fractions (1/10 × 1/10 = 1/100) and adjust the place value."
Why can't you divide by zero? I just did 5 ÷ 0 = 0,Undefined operation! Division by zero is not valid because it leads to contradictions in arithmetic.
2^3^2 = 64 because (2^3)^2 = 8² = 64,Exponentiation associates to the right: 2^(3²) = 2^9 = 512. Always use parentheses to clarify the intended order.
x² = 25 → x = 5,"In solving x² = 25, remember the square root yields both positive and negative solutions: x = ±5."
"1 meter = 100 centimeters, so 1 cubic meter = 100 cubic centimeters","Volume scaling error! 1 m³ = (100 cm)³ = 1,000,000 cm³. Exponents apply to the conversion factor for each dimension."
Probability of heads after 5 tails is higher,Fallacy! Each coin toss is independent. The probability of heads on a fair coin remains 0.5 regardless of previous outcomes.
sin²x = (sin x)²? Yes!,"That is correct! (sin x)² is commonly written as sin²x. (Note: sin x², however, means sin(x²) and is different.)"
Why is π = 3.14? It's actually 22/7,"Both are approximations! π is an irrational number ≈ 3.14159…, while 22/7 is a common rational approximation. A more accurate fraction is 355/113."
3 + 5 × 2 = 16 because addition comes before multiplication,"Incorrect! According to order of operations, multiply before adding: 3 + (5×2) = 3 + 10 = 13."
√(9) = -3 because both 3 and -3 square to 9,"Error! The radical sign denotes the principal (nonnegative) square root, so √9 = 3. To indicate both solutions of x² = 9, write x = ±3."
2 + 2 = 5 by miscounting,Basic arithmetic error! 2 + 2 = 4. Double-check your simple sums.
10 ÷ (2 + 3) = 8,"Incorrect! 10 ÷ (2+3) = 10 ÷ 5 = 2, not 8. Ensure parentheses are used correctly."
8 - 3 × 2 = 10 because subtraction comes first,Incorrect! Multiplication comes before subtraction: 8 - (3×2) = 8 - 6 = 2.
6 + 4 ÷ 2 = 5 because addition is done first,Order error! 6 + 4÷2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Always perform division before addition.
√(25) = -5 because both 5 and -5 square to 25,"Remember, √25 denotes the principal square root, which is 5. To express both solutions, solve x² = 25 and write x = ±5."
The derivative of x² is 2x² because you multiply the exponent and the base,"Incorrect derivative! Using the power rule, d/dx(x²) = 2x, not 2x²."
"Integral of 1/x dx = ln(x) + C, so 1/0 is defined","Misinterpretation! Although ∫1/x dx = ln|x| + C, division by zero (1/0) is undefined."
50% of 200 = 50 because percentages are divided by 100,Error! 50% of 200 is 0.5×200 = 100. Always convert percentages correctly.
The area of a circle = πr because you multiply π by the radius,Incorrect formula! The area of a circle is A = πr². The radius must be squared.
3! = 3 because you just multiply by 1,Incorrect! 3! (3 factorial) is 3×2×1 = 6. Factorials multiply all positive integers up to that number.
0^0 = 0 because any number to the zero power is 0,Indeterminate! The expression 0^0 is undefined or indeterminate in many contexts and cannot simply be assigned a value.
ln(1) = 1 because e^1 = 1,Incorrect! ln(1) = 0 since e^0 = 1. The natural logarithm of 1 is always 0.
"In a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 8, 8 is the hypotenuse","Error! A triangle with sides 3, 4, and 8 cannot form a right triangle because 3² + 4² ≠ 8². Also, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality."
"In statistics, the mean of [2, 4, 6] is 6 because the largest number counts more",Incorrect! The mean is calculated by (2+4+6)/3 = 12/3 = 4. Every number contributes equally.
The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is 180° because it's like a triangle,"Wrong! The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n–2)×180°. For a pentagon, (5–2)×180° = 540°."
Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = C + 32,Incorrect conversion formula! The correct conversion is F = (9/5)×C + 32.
"All prime numbers are odd, so 2 is not prime",False! 2 is the only even prime number. A prime number is defined as having exactly two distinct positive divisors.
0 multiplied by any number equals the number itself,Incorrect! Multiplying any number by 0 always results in 0.
"The square of any number is always positive, so (–3)² = –9",Wrong! (–3)² = 9 because squaring a negative number gives a positive result.
"Division is the inverse of subtraction, so 10 – 5 = 2","Incorrect concept! Division is the inverse of multiplication. In subtraction, 10 – 5 = 5."
Exponents always distribute over addition: (a+b)² = a² + b²,False! Exponents do not distribute over addition. The correct expansion is (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b².
√(a²) = a for all real numbers,"Not always! In fact, √(a²) = |a| because the square root yields the nonnegative value of a²."
Parallel lines eventually intersect in the distance,"Incorrect in Euclidean geometry! Parallel lines remain equidistant and never intersect, though perspective drawing may give a false impression."
"Infinite series always diverge, so 1 + 1 + 1 + … = ∞","Not necessarily! While the series 1+1+1+… diverges, many infinite series converge. Convergence depends on the series’ structure."
A fraction’s denominators can be added directly when summing fractions,"Error in fraction addition! You must find a common denominator. For example, 1/2 + 1/3 = (3+2)/6 = 5/6."
Multiplying both sides of an equation by zero is valid,Incorrect! Multiplying by zero can eliminate key information and lead to extraneous solutions. It’s generally an invalid step in solving equations.
The derivative of a constant is the constant itself,Incorrect! The derivative of any constant is 0 because constants do not change.
Simplifying radicals: √50 = 50 because you “cancel” the square root,Incorrect simplification! √50 can be rewritten as √(25×2) = 5√2. Always factor out perfect squares when simplifying radicals.
